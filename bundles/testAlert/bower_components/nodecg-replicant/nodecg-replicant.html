<!--
The `nodecg-replicant` element binds to a Replicant. Once bound, the value of the replicant can be retrieved and set
from the `value` property.

    <nodecg-replicant replicant-name="myReplicant" replicant-bundle="my-bundle"></nodecg-replicant>

This element is useful in cases where instantiating and binding to a replicant in a purely declarative fashion
is desirable. For example, it can be used to create a two-way binding with a `paper-input` element.

    <nodecg-replicant name="myReplicant" value="{{value}}"></nodecg-replicant>
    <paper-input label="myReplicant" value="{{value}}"></paper-input>

It is important to note that the replicant will not be declared until the element has been attached and the current
task has finished. This is to avoid two-way binding conflicts. For example, when binding to an `iron-input`
element, the `iron-input` will default to a `bind-value` of `""`, which would then be assigned to the Replicant,
deleting the Replicant's intended value.
