NodeCG is two things:

1. A programming framework with which to create broadcast graphics and control panels.
2. An application for serving those graphics and control panels.

The best way to quickly get a feel for what NodeCG does is to watch these videos that go over some bundles that have been made with it:

- [A twelve-part video series breaking down the graphics used at Awesome Games Done Quick 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBAZXchbI3U&list=PLTEhlYdONYxv1wk2FsIpEz92X3x2E7bSx)
- [A 20-minute video detailing the graphics for Tip of the Hats 2016 (a smaller charity fundraiser)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0xGN-aSytA)
